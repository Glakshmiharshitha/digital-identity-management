User Authentication and Digital Identity System
This repository contains a simple Python-based user authentication system that uses hashed passwords for secure login and generates a digital identity token for authenticated users. The system is implemented using two main classes, User and DigitalIdentity, and includes a function for secure authentication.
Features:
1.Secure password hashing using SHA-256.
2.Random token generation for digital identity using the secrets module.
3.Command-line interface for user login.
4.Basic authentication flow.
